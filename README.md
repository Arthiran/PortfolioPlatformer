# Welcome to Arthiran's Portfolio Repository

For my portfolio, I wanted to create something that would stand out amidst a sea of other portfolios. The first ever game I programmed was a 2D platformer in Unity, so I decided I'd give it another go with everything I've learned.

The porfolio showcases some of my solo projects, and school projects. They all have a gameplay video, description, and a link to either the github project, or a link to the published game. 

The most important feature I wanted to add was to display my projects, but in the future, I'd like to continue adding in more platformer mechanics, and eventually have an end-goal for the player.

All assets in the game were created by myself.

I hope you enjoy!
